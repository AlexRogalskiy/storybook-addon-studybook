# Welcome to Studybook

Studybook augments your Storybook UI with controls to track progress as if it's a learning aid. The confetti is free!
It does this by keeping track of which stories are completed in `localStorage`.

## Install Studybook

Let's start off light with your first study lesson.

This means installing `Studybook`.

<Story name="Install" parameters={{ viewMode: 'docs' }}>
  <Source
    code="
    yarn add storybook-addon-studybook
  "
    dark
  />
</Story>

Got this far? Cool. Hit this button ðŸ‘‡

<Button name="Install" />

You completed your first study lesson. Notice how the badge at the top changed?

## Set Up

Now we've installed `Studybook`, let's use it in a Storybook. Update the `addons` within `.storybook/main.js`.

<Story name="Integrate" parameters={{ viewMode: 'docs' }}>
  <Source
    code="
module.exports = {
  stories: [...],
  addons: [
    '...'
    'storybook-addon-studybook'
  ] }
  "
    dark
    format
  />
</Story>

You know what to do! ðŸ‘‡

<Button name="Integrate" />

## Panels and Badges

By now you should've noticed the additional pieces of UI floating about.
When viewing the Canvas for a story, you have a new tab, "Study". That contains a button that allows you
to toggle whether a story has been completed. You don't need to do anything to make this appear.
It will appear on all stories by **default**.

You may have also noticed that badge at the top. This will appear in both the "Canvas" and "Docs" tabs. It will either show the current progress for a story or what we like to call, a "Chapter". A "Chapter" is a collection of stories.
If you've been following along, when you hit this button, we should have 3/4 stories complete.

<Story name="Panels and Badges" parameters={{ viewMode: 'docs' }}></Story>

<Button name="Panels and Badges" />

## Docs Button

These "Complete" buttons you've been pressing are also a component you can use in your Storybook docs. There's one caveat.
They must have a `name` prop that matches the story they are toggling. Being able to toggle multiple stories is WIP.

For example, to create a button that toggles the first lesson we would do the following.

<Story name="Docs Button" parameters={{ viewMode: 'docs' }}>
  <Source
    format
    code="
import { Button } from 'storybook-addon-studybook/blocks'
<Button name='Install'/>
  "
    dark
  />
</Story>

That gives us something like this. Hit this to toggle completing the first lesson.

<Canvas>
  <Button name="Install" />
</Canvas>

And that's the "Docs Button" ðŸŽ‰ You know what to do.

<Button name="Docs Button" />

## That's It!

Awesome! You made it! That's where `Studybook` is at for the moment. It's a proof of concept.
But, it could be easily extended and moulded to will.

Hit that last button. You learned about Studybook!

<Story name="Complete" parameters={{ viewMode: 'docs' }}></Story>

<Button name="Complete" />
